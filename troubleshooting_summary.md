# FMS Application: System Overview and Troubleshooting Summary

## System Purpose and Overview

The Facilities Management System (FMS) is designed to streamline the management of facilities, assets, services, and work orders for educational institutions (schools within regions). Key features include:

*   **Stakeholder Management:** Managing users (admins, school staff, contractors) with different roles and permissions.
*   **Asset Tracking:** Recording and managing school assets.
*   **Service Management:** Defining and managing services offered.
*   **Work Order Management:** Creating, assigning, tracking, and managing work orders for maintenance and repairs.
*   **SLA/KPI Tracking:** Defining Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and tracking performance against them.
*   **Reporting:** Generating reports on various aspects of facility management.
*   **Notifications:** Sending notifications related to work orders and other events.

The system consists of a:
*   **Backend:** A Flask (Python) application providing a REST API for data management and business logic.
*   **Frontend:** A React (TypeScript) single-page application providing the user interface.

## Troubleshooting History and Issues Encountered

This document summarizes the significant steps and challenges encountered while deploying and testing the FMS application.

**1. Initial Deployment Attempts (Manus Platform):**
*   The backend and frontend were initially deployed to the Manus platform.
*   **Issue:** Persistent Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) errors prevented the frontend from communicating with the backend API. Requests from the frontend origin were blocked because the backend deployment on Manus was not sending the required `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` headers, despite the Flask application code being configured correctly.
*   **Troubleshooting:** Multiple tests (OPTIONS, POST requests to various endpoints) confirmed the CORS headers were missing or incorrect at the platform level. Attempts to redeploy on Manus did not resolve the issue.
*   **Resolution:** Due to the platform limitations preventing proper CORS configuration, deployment was shifted to an external platform (Render).

**2. Backend Code Refactoring (Imports/Routing):**
*   **Issue:** During local testing and preparation for Render deployment, issues were found with Python imports (relative vs. absolute) and Flask route definitions (conflicting root route definitions).
*   **Troubleshooting:** The code was refactored to use absolute imports (`from src.models import ...`) and ensure routes were correctly defined and registered using Flask Blueprints.
*   **Resolution:** The backend code was corrected and tested locally.

**3. Render Backend Deployment:**
*   The backend (packaged with Docker) was deployed to Render (`https://fms-backend-ft1y.onrender.com`).
*   **Issue 1:** Initial tests showed the service was running (root URL `/` was accessible), but API endpoints (`/api/v1/...`) returned "404 Not Found" errors. CORS headers were also missing from the root URL response.
*   **Issue 2:** Subsequent deployment attempts resulted in consistent "500 Internal Server Error" responses across all endpoints, indicating application startup failures or runtime errors.
*   **Troubleshooting:** Verified Render deployment status, logs (when available), and start commands. Confirmed API blueprints were registered in the code.
*   **Resolution:** After user intervention to fix the Render deployment configuration, the backend started responding correctly to API requests.

**4. API Field Mismatch (`username` vs. `email`):**
*   **Issue:** Once the Render backend API was accessible, login attempts failed with a "422 Unprocessable Entity" error, indicating the backend expected a `username` field, but the frontend was sending `email`.
*   **Troubleshooting:** Reviewed backend (`auth_routes.py`) and frontend (`authService.ts`) code. The reviewed code consistently used `email`. The discrepancy suggested the code deployed on Render was an older version.
*   **Resolution:** User confirmed the correct backend code (expecting `email`) was deployed to Render, resolving the 422 error.

**5. Authentication Failure (401 Invalid Credentials):**
*   **Issue:** After resolving the field mismatch, login attempts consistently failed with a 401 "Invalid Credentials" error for the `admin@example.com` user, using the password `FM-System-2025!`.
*   **Troubleshooting:**
    *   Re-ran the `create_admin.py` script locally to ensure the user exists and the password hash is set correctly in the *local* database.
    *   Tested login API directly via `curl` â€“ confirmed 401 error persisted.
    *   Hypothesized that the local database update did not affect the separate database used by the live Render deployment.
*   **Current Status:** The 401 error remains the primary blocker for login. The password for `admin@example.com` in the Render database likely does not match the expected hash.

**6. Temporary Password Bypass Attempts:**
*   To allow system access for viewing, modifications were made to the backend code to bypass password checks:
    *   First attempt: Bypassed check only for `admin@example.com`.
    *   Second attempt: Bypassed check for *all* users (highly insecure).
*   **Issue:** Login tests using the frontend after these bypass attempts resulted in connection errors (`Connection lost: The server closed the connection` or `net::ERR_HTTP_RESPONSE_CODE_FAILURE`), suggesting the deployed bypass code might be causing the backend to crash or fail during the login process, or that the bypass code was not successfully deployed by the user.
*   **Resolution:** Reverted backend code to the secure version with standard password checks enabled, as requested by the user.

**7. Frontend Instability:**
*   **Issue:** Throughout the process, the frontend deployment (`https://xthomjyv.manus.space`) occasionally became unavailable, showing 404 errors or connection errors, requiring checks and sometimes redeployment.
*   **Current Status:** The frontend was accessible during the last check but showed connection errors during login attempts.

## Current Status and Next Steps

*   **Backend (`https://fms-backend-ft1y.onrender.com`):** Deployed with secure code. API is accessible, CORS is correct, `email` field is accepted. **Login fails with 401 Invalid Credentials.**
*   **Frontend (`https://xthomjyv.manus.space`):** Deployed, but showed instability and connection errors during recent login attempts.

**Recommended Next Steps:**
1.  **Fix Backend Authentication:** Address the 401 error by verifying and resetting the password hash for `admin@example.com` directly within the **Render database**. Investigate the password hashing/checking logic (`set_password`/`check_password` in `stakeholder.py`) if necessary.
2.  **Stabilize Frontend:** Investigate the cause of the frontend connection errors and potentially redeploy the static files from `/home/ubuntu/fms_frontend/dist` if instability persists.
